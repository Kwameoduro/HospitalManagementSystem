# Hospital Information System

## My HIS
My HIS is an application for a (hypothetical) hospital that ensures easy management of its daily operations. Employees (Doctors and Nurses) and Patients details are stored in the Hospital's database (MySQL). Basic create, read, update and delete operations can executed on all the entities (Patient, Doctor and Nurse).  

My HIS has a user friendly interface.

These are the major classes in the application:
- [Application UI](https://github.com/Kwameoduro/HospitalManagementSystem/blob/main/src/main/com.hospital/ui/HospitalManagementSystem.java)
- [Main](https://github.com/Kwameoduro/HospitalManagementSystem/blob/main/src/main/com.hospital/main/HospitalApp.java)
